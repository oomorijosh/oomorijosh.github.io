  When we communicate in any language, certain rules govern our word choices and structures. For example, a basic sentence requires at least a subject and a verb; thus, “I good” is incorrect because it lacks a verb. These language rules also extend to context, such as the difference in formality between an interview and a conversation with friends. This concept can be applied to programming languages, which also have their own standards.
  Language can be learned in two primary ways: through formal education or through immersive experiences. Classroom learning emphasizes spelling and grammar, offering a structured approach that can be replicated. In contrast, experiential learning, often gained through daily interactions, focuses on effective communication, prioritizing understanding over strict adherence to rules.
  Both methods have their pros and cons. Classroom learning provides a streamlined, systematic foundation, while experiential learning facilitates practical application in real-world scenarios. Thus, the question arises: which method is superior? The reality is that both are crucial; for instance, classroom instruction provides essential grammar knowledge, while everyday interactions help learners grasp the nuances of language.
  Applying this to coding standards, one can argue that while rigid standards may not be strictly necessary, they serve as valuable tools in mastering a programming language. Without foundational rules, learning to code could be chaotic, similar to learning a spoken language without understanding grammar.
  Ultimately, while coding languages and spoken languages serve different purposes, both benefit from a balance of structure and flexibility. The goal of this essay is to explore how coding standards, viewed through the lens of language learning, enhance professionalism and effectiveness in programming.
